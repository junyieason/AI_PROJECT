## Introduction

Welcome to the Wiki for team 096's project in the UoM COMP90054-2023 Pacman Competition. In this collaborative effort, the team has explored and learned to implement an autonomous agent capable of competing in the PACMAN - Capture the Flag game. A diverse range of artificial intelligence techniques have been leveraged, including Q learning, Monte-Carlo Tree Search, Heuristics, and Multiplayer to develop multiple intelligent Pacman agents. Overall, the experimented approaches focus on generalizing specific AI techniques that can adapt to different games and accommodate minor changes to game rules, which allows the agents to be more versatile and resilient. Meanwhile, these agents represent the characteristics of each technique. Their detailed explanations, pros and cons are precisely discussed in the Wiki sections. With a significant amount of experimenting and testing, the agent adopted Heuristics and Multiplayer is chosen to participate in the tournament and excel in this dynamic gaming environment.

This Wiki will serve as a valuable resource in understanding the teamâ€™s progress in the UoM COMP90054-2023 Pacman Competition, the approaches to creating autonomous agents, and the challenges and successes the team encountered along the way.
